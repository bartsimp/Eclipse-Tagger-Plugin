	<h1>Introduction</h1>

	<img src="rc/img/navandview.gif" style="float:right;border:1px solid silver;" /><p>The Resource Tagger Plug-in adds tagging functionality to <a href="http://eclipse.org">Eclipse</a> such that resources may be tagged
	similar to the content tagging in <a href="http://del.icio.us">Del.icio.us</a> and <a href="http://gmail.com">Gmail</a>. The tagged
	resources may then be managed, searched, filtered, or otherwise operated on by their tag associations.</p>

	<h2>News</h2>

	<p><i>(12/15/2006)</i> The first release is out the door! Now, to see if we can get some users and interest. Work will begin on bugs and new features soon.</p>

	<h2>Current Release</h2>

	<p>The current release is 1.0.1 (a bugfix release of the 1.0 code line). The plug-in jar can be downloaded from sourceforge or installed as a feature via
	the update site. The source is available via the subversion repository.</p>

	<h2>Internet Explorer Issues</h2>
	<p>Currently, this site does not look very good in IE7 (and probably IE6); it is best viewed using <a href="http://getfirefox.com">FireFox</a>...
	why would you want to use anything else anyway?</p>
