workspace-scope
	-	tags/associations defined for the workspace only
	-	allow tag/association storage location to be defined
	
project-scope
	-	tags/associations defined for the project only
	x	taggable nature - to define projects that are taggable
	-	tags can only be used in project they are defined
	-	allow tag/association storage location to be defined (within project only on add of nature)
	
-	tags/associations may be shared across multiple projects
	-	should have import/export to/from project-project
-	store tags as id,name,description (should I add date,author?)
-	store associations as path,tagids
-	ability to merge tags (in case duplicates created by others)
	
-	tags view will be broken down by project/tags/associations
	-	negates the need for a tag association view
	-	should be filterable by project, tag(s)
-	break up into multiple smaller plugins based on functionality
-	break out frills plugins into separate project
-	add quick search (like CTRL-O) where type in tag name to get list of tags (selection opens all tagged)

!	need to handle open/close of project to add/remove to tag/association active data
!	need to handle external tag/association update (refresh)
!	provide a conversion tool to automatcially bring users up-to-date with new specs

-	consider integration points with TagSEA
