	<h1>Features</h1>
	
	<h2>Resource Tagging</h2>
	
	<p>Any Eclipse resource can have one or more tags associated with it. The goal of these tags is to provide an alternate means 
	of grouping and working with resources.</p>
	
	
	<h2>Tag Management</h2>
	
	<p>The tag set available to the workspace is managed through a tag view. Tag can be added, edited and removed using this view.</p>
	
	
	<h2>Search by Tag Association</h2>
	
	<p>Tagged files can be found via their tag associations. Currently the search is limited to either requiring all tags be associated with 
	the resource or any of the specified tags.</p>
	
	
	<h2>Create Working Set From Tags</h2>
	
	<p>From the Tag Manager View, a working set can be created from all resources tagged with specified tags.</p>
